### Validation Status
- `⚪ Pending` — No validation performed yet.
- `🟡 Partially validated` — Basic connectivity or services confirmed.
- `✅ Validated` — Guest validated according to the current runbook scope.
- `🔴 Validation failed` — Issues found during post-install checks.

## 📓 Per-Guest Notes

### 🛠️ `srv-admin`
- First deployed guest and reference installation model for the lab.
- Successfully installed on **RHEL 10.1**.
- Hostname validated inside the guest as `srv-admin`.
- Connected to the `lab-int` network with DHCP-assigned connectivity.
- Visible and validated from the Fedora 43 host using `virsh`.
- Autostart enabled after successful validation.
- Screenshot set completed for Phase 02.
- This guest now serves as the baseline installation pattern for the remaining nodes.

### 🌐 `srv-web`
- Intended for web-facing service work in later phases.
- Should reuse the validated `srv-admin` installation pattern.

### 🗄️ `srv-db`
- Intended for database-related service work in later phases.
- Should begin with the same clean guest model used for `srv-admin`.

### 💾 `srv-storage`
- Intended for shared storage workflows and later NFS/autofs exercises.
- May require additional virtual disk planning in future phases.

## 🔄 Tracking & Maintenance
Update this file whenever one of the following events occurs:

1. A guest is defined or created in `libvirt`
2. Hardware resources (RAM, vCPU, disk) are modified
3. Installation or validation phases are completed
4. Screenshots are captured and stored in the assets folder
5. Autostart or other persistent VM behavior is changed

## 🚩 Current Phase Alignment
- **Phase 00:** Repository Bootstrap ✅
- **Phase 01:** Virtualization Host Ready ✅
- **Phase 02:** First Guest Deployment ✅

**Current validated guest:** `srv-admin`  
**Next planned guests:** `srv-web`, `srv-db`, `srv-storage`

The remaining guests stay in `Pending` state until their deployments begin.
