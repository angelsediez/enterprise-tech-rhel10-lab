## 📓 Per-Guest Notes

### 🛠️ `srv-admin`
- First deployed guest and reference installation model for the lab.
- Successfully installed on **RHEL 10.1**.
- Hostname validated inside the guest as `srv-admin`.
- Connected to the `lab-int` network with DHCP-assigned connectivity.
- Visible and validated from the Fedora 43 host using `virsh`.
- Autostart enabled after successful validation.
- Screenshot set completed for Phase 02.
- This guest served as the baseline installation pattern for the remaining nodes.

### 🌐 `srv-web`
- Successfully deployed using the validated `srv-admin` installation pattern.
- Installed on **RHEL 10.1** with hostname `srv-web`.
- Connected to the `lab-int` network with DHCP-assigned connectivity.
- Validated from both guest-side and host-side.
- Autostart enabled after successful validation.
- Screenshot set completed for the Phase 02 deployment workflow.
- This guest confirms successful reuse of the baseline deployment pattern after `srv-admin`.

### 🗄️ `srv-db`
- Successfully deployed using the validated installation pattern established by `srv-admin` and reused for `srv-web`.
- Installed on **RHEL 10.1** with hostname `srv-db`.
- Connected to the `lab-int` network with DHCP-assigned connectivity.
- Validated from both guest-side and host-side.
- Autostart enabled after successful validation.
- Screenshot set completed for the Phase 02 deployment workflow.

### 💾 `srv-storage`
- Successfully deployed using the validated installation pattern established by the previous guests.
- Installed on **RHEL 10.1** with hostname `srv-storage`.
- Connected to the `lab-int` network with DHCP-assigned connectivity.
